		<p>After you've put together your computer and confirmed it works and all components are properly in place there are only a few final steps to complete. You need to buy a cd key for the windows Operating System of your preference, or if you prefer Linux, that is free to download. so after booting up your Operating System from a Flashdrive or a disk there are only a few steps remaining. First you need to update any drives for your computers GPU primarily and any others that are also available. You need to get an anti-virus software, a password, and of course a new background picture. </p>
		<p>This concludes my guide from building a computer of course there were somethings that I didn't cover that can modify your experience when using a computer drastically, such as headphones, DAC, AMPs, and multiple monitor setups to name a few things that can enhance your experience when using a computer. Naturally of course you can't forget a good chair and desk.</p>
