		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Getting down to actually picking out, buying, and building the computer there are many resources for you to use. One very important resource to take note of is <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" title="Pcpartpicker">Pcpartpicker</a> This site gives easy assess to tons of information for you to use. It allows know any problems in incompatibility for the parts you picked out and lets you see a price breakdown of the parts you've picked out so far and the total. Additionally, this site breaks down price via retailer so you know who is offering the best price. For someone who knows nothing about computers this is a great place to start.</p>
		<p>Continuing on information about how to specifically put together each part can be learned in multiple ways. One way is to use the manual that the computer parts come with another is to watch the video example below. Even just googling what component does what and what each of the specifications mean on each components can teach you a rather large amount of information. It is always recommended to research thoroughly before going through with a purchase to ensure that you don't have to spend time sending parts back, which is why the least recommend way of learning how to build a pc is through the manuals they come with as you should large have an idea of what your doing before committing to a purchase. Although, once you have gone through with a purchase that doesn't mean you shouldn't go through the manual if you get a little lost.</p>
